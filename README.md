# Lab 1 Fixes

## What I fixed on the html

- I was able to add the `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- I also fixed the `<a href="https://example.com">Click Here to view my profile</a>` as the tag was not complete with the `>`.
- Also fixed the struture of the body tag comming after the html tag.
- Finally fixed the meta tags to have correct back stalshes within the tag.
